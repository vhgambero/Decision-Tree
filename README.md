# Scikit Learn Decision Tree Repository
This repository is intended for the exploration and implementation of Decision Tree models using the Scikit-learn library. Decision trees are a popular machine learning technique for classification and regression tasks, offering interpretable and visual representations of decision-making processes.

## Purpose
The primary objectives of this repository are to:

### Model Implementation:
Document the implementation of decision tree algorithms using Scikit-learn on various datasets.

### Parameter Tuning:
Analyze the impact of different hyperparameters, such as tree depth and splitting criteria, on model performance.

### Visualizations:
Provide visual representations of decision trees to enhance understanding of their structure and decision-making processes.

## Methodology
Data Preparation:
Preprocess datasets, including cleaning, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.

### Model Training:
Implement decision tree models using Scikit-learn, focusing on both classification and regression tasks.

### Model Evaluation:
Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Visualization:
Create visual representations of decision trees to improve interpretability.

## Technologies Used
### Python:
Primary programming language for implementing decision trees.

### Scikit-learn:
Library used for building and evaluating decision tree models.

### Pandas:
For data manipulation and preprocessing.

### Matplotlib and Seaborn:
For data visualization.

## Future Developments
As I continue to explore decision tree models, I plan to investigate advanced variations such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees and apply these techniques to various datasets.
